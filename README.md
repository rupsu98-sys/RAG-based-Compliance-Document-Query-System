# RAG-based Compliance Document Query System  

*Designed and implemented as part of an applied NLP project to showcase retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for compliance and regulatory workflows.*  

---

## Why This Project Matters  

Industries like **pharma, law, and corporate governance** rely on **dense, ever-changing regulatory documents**. Manually navigating these guidelines slows down operations and risks costly errors.  

This project shows how **AI-driven RAG pipelines** can:  
- Cut through compliance complexity.  
- Provide **fast, accurate, natural language answers** from massive document sets.  
- Empower both **business teams** and **researchers** with scalable, adaptable tools for knowledge retrieval.  

---

## What It Does  

- **Document Ingestion & Preprocessing** → Parses PDFs, DOCX, and structured files.  
- **Semantic Search & Embeddings** → Finds the most relevant text sections.  
- **Generative AI Querying** → Produces context-aware answers to user questions.  
- **Scalable Architecture** → Adaptable to different industries and domains.  

---

## Key Applications  

- **Pharma & FDA Compliance** → Query regulatory guidelines and SOPs instantly.  
- **Legal & Policy Review** → Assist lawyers in navigating dense legal codes.  
- **Corporate Knowledge Management** → Help employees access internal manuals fast.  
- **Research & Academia** → Retrieve and summarize academic or technical literature.  

---

## Research Extensions  

- **Multilingual Retrieval** for international regulations.  
- **Executive Summaries** generated from long documents.  
- **Bias & Consistency Detection** in regulatory texts.  
- **Knowledge Graph Integration** to connect policies and regulations.  

---

## Skills & Tools Demonstrated  

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** embeddings, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering.  
- **Information Retrieval:** semantic similarity search, vector databases (FAISS, Chroma).  
- **Data Handling:** text preprocessing, document parsing.  
- **Software Engineering:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain.

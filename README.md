RAG-based Compliance Document Query System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for efficiently navigating complex compliance and regulatory documents.

Overview

In industries teams handle large volumes of dense regulatory documents. Manually finding relevant information is time-consuming and error-prone. This project demonstrates how RAG pipelines can automate and enhance document retrieval and comprehension by combining semantic search with generative NLP models.

Features
Document Ingestion & Preprocessing: Supports PDFs, DOCX, and structured documents for large-scale compliance datasets.

Semantic Search & Embeddings: Retrieves the most relevant document sections for a given query.

Generative Query Responses: Provides concise, context-aware answers to natural language questions.

Workflow Optimization: Reduces manual review effort and accelerates compliance checks.

Extensible & Scalable: Modular design allows adaptation to other domains, languages, or data types.

Potential Research Directions

Multilingual Compliance Processing: Extend retrieval for international regulations.

Automated Summarization & Reporting: Generate executive-level summaries from long documents.

Bias Detection & Cross-Referencing: Identify inconsistencies or high-risk sections automatically.

Integration with Knowledge Graphs: Enhance relational understanding between documents and regulatory entities.
